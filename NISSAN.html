             the 20th century, with the Nissan zaibatsu, now called Nissan Group.

                Motors.In 2017, Nissan was the sixth largest automaker in the world, 
                after Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, General Motors and
                 Ford.In 2014, Nissan was the largest car manufacturer in North 
                 America. With a revenue of $78 billion in 2022, Nissan was the 9th largest 
                 automobile maker in the world, as well as being the leading Japanese brand
                  in China, Russia and Mexico.[11] As of April 2018, Nissan was the world's
                   largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, with global sales of more than
                    320,000 all-electric vehicles.[12] The top-selling vehicle of the
             car-maker's fully-electric lineup is the Nissan LEAF, the No. 2
              top-selling electric car globally, just behind the Tesla Model 3.
