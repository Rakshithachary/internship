        <h1>CAR</h1>
         <p>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. 
            Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, 
            seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, 
            not cargo. French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the 
            first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor
             François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal 
             combustion-powered automobile in 1808.

            The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was 
            invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his 
            Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during
             the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was
              the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
               Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they 
               replaced horse-drawn carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world,
                demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.
                The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.</p>
