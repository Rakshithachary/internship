        <p><b>Toyota Motor Corporation  Toyota  is a Japanese multinational automotive
             manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. It was founded
              by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the 
              largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million 
              vehicles per year.The company was originally founded as a spinoff of 
              Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, 
              Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group,
               one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department 
               of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type 
               A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.
            After World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the 
            United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, 
            which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the 
            Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that 
            transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and
             was the subject of many academic studies.</b></p>
